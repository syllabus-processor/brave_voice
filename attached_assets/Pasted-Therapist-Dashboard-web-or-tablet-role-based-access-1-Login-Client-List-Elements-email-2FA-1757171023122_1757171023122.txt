Therapist Dashboard (web or tablet, role-based access)
1) Login & Client List

Elements: email + 2FA; role (Therapist / Supervisor); HIPAA/GDPR consent banner; search; filters (age, school, referral source).

Clients table: Nickname/ID (no PHI by default), last activity, guardian consent status, flags (risk, access issues), “Open Profile.”

Why: Centralizes structured/ongoing assessment data and keeps the purpose of assessment transparent and collaborative.

2) Client Profile — Overview

Top strip

Snapshot: age range, presenting goals, guardian contact (if enabled), access accommodations (language, reading level).

Stage of change tag (optional): Pre-contemplation → Maintenance (for MI-consistent coaching).

Panels

Recent Activity: last stories played, choices (passive/aggressive/assertive), badges, “Brave Voice” lines saved.

Confidence Trend: 0–10 line chart over time; session markers; therapist notes pinboard.

Cross-Cutting Check-ins (optional): brief symptom snapshots the child/guardian completes (sleep, mood, anxiety) for pattern awareness—not diagnosis. (Maps to DSM-5-TR’s dimensional/cross-cutting spirit when used judiciously).

Why: Blends quantitative (trend, frequencies) and qualitative (notes, artifacts) data to support treatment planning and progress verification.

3) Story Path Explorer (Session Prep)

Timeline view of the most recent story: scene → choice → outcome → reflection.

Heatmap across weeks: % passive / % aggressive / % assertive.

Artifacts: tap to open the child’s Shield designs and saved “Brave Voice” sentences (helpful for alliance building, communicating findings back to families in plain language).

4) Assignments (“Missions”) Builder

Create structured between-session tasks that feel playful to kids and actionable to parents:

Templates

Replay Scene (e.g., “Ruby & the Dragon,” encourage an assertive choice).

Brave Voice Builder (pre-filled sentence stems; child records & plays back).

Shield Redesign (prompt tied to a trigger: “When someone takes your turn…”).

In-Vivo Log (one real-life try; pick emoji for how it went).

Scheduling: due dates, reminders to guardian device, frequency.

Targets & Measures: confidence baseline, simple 3-item reflection.

Clinical note seed: auto-collects completion + quick reflection for your note.

Why: Moves assessment from “one event” to iterative monitoring & outcome evaluation—a best practice in counseling assessment.

5) Feedback & Messaging (Coach Lane)

Choose a strength-based nudge (“I noticed you tried your Brave Voice—nice work staying calm.”).

Audio sticker (therapist voice memo ≤30s) if consented—keeps alliance warm between sessions.

6) Reports & Export

Progress Summary: confidence trend, story distribution, completed missions, selected quotes/reflections.

Session Prep Sheet: last week’s engagement, suggested prompts (“What made speaking up hard?”), next-step goals.

PDF/CSV export with plain-language narratives for communicating results ethically and clearly to caregivers/teams.

7) Settings, Privacy & Cultural/Linguistic Access

Consent & Sharing: guardian consent dashboard, who can view what, revoke at any time.

Data Minimization: pseudonyms by default; no unnecessary identifiers; local encryption + limited retention windows.

Language & Reading Level: UI language toggle, icon-forward mode, closed captions/audio narration.

Fairness & Bias safeguards: avoid scoring that stigmatizes; present findings as supports for learning, not labels; include context (home/school culture).
