Here’s an age-appropriate assertiveness exercise for a 10-year-old dealing with a bullying older sister:

🛡️ “My Brave Voice” Role-Play Exercise
Goal: Teach the child to express their feelings clearly and respectfully, especially when being mistreated by a sibling.

Step 1: Warm-Up – “Feelings First”
Ask the child to name and draw 3 feelings they often feel when their sister is mean or teasing them. Discuss:
What makes them feel that way?


What would they like to feel instead?


📝 Tool: Use simple feelings flashcards or draw emojis.

Step 2: Teaching Assertive Language
Introduce the difference between:
Passive (“I guess it’s okay if you take my things.”)


Aggressive (“You’re such a jerk!”)


Assertive (“I don’t like it when you take my things without asking. Please stop.”)


Practice this structure:
“I feel ____ when you ____. Please ____.”
👂 Tip: Say it standing tall, with a calm voice and good eye contact (practice using a mirror).

Step 3: Practice Scenarios
Role-play 2-3 real or imagined scenes, like:
Sister calling them names.


Sister not letting them play with shared toys.


Take turns being the big sister and the child. Encourage the child to use their “Brave Voice” in each scene.

Step 4: Reflection & Empowerment
After each role-play, ask:
“How did that feel?”


“What worked well?”


“What might you do differently next time?”


🌟 Bonus: Make a “Brave Voice Certificate” or shield to reinforce their effort and growing skill.

Step 5: Plan for Real Life
Help the child identify 1 situation this week to try their Brave Voice. Check in afterwards.
🛠️ Optional Tools:
Assertiveness comic strips


Emotion Thermometers (to identify when it's time to speak up)


Puppet play



Let me know if you'd like this adapted for classroom use or to include sibling/family counseling strategies.

what if we could turn this into an app for a Samsung Galaxy Tablet?

That’s a fantastic idea—and very doable! Turning the "Liam and the Brave Voice Mission" into an interactive mobile app for a Samsung Galaxy Tablet (which uses Android OS) would make the assertiveness training engaging and accessible for kids. Here's a breakdown of what that would involve and how you could approach development:

📱 App Concept: Brave Voice Adventures
🎯 Core Features
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Story


Interactive story branching with choices that guide different outcomes.


Animated or illustrated scenes with voice-over (optional).


Points/rewards for using assertiveness effectively.


Brave Voice Practice Zone


Script builder for assertive statements (“I feel ___ when you ___. Please ___.”)


Audio recording option to hear their own Brave Voice.


Mirror mode with animated characters for role-play.


Create Your Own Shield


Drawing tool with templates to design a “Brave Voice Shield.”


Option to save/share artwork.


Parent/Counselor Dashboard


Simple summary of choices made and progress.


Tips for continuing assertiveness coaching at home.



🧱 Tech Stack Overview
Platform: Android (targeted for Galaxy Tablets, but scalable)


Frontend: Kotlin or Flutter (Flutter allows for both Android and future iOS support)


Backend: Firebase (for saving progress, storing artwork, and login if needed)


Assets: Unity (if going for animated storybook style), or just native Android XML views for simple interactivity



🛠️ Development Plan
Phase 1: Prototype (2–4 weeks)
Develop one full choose-your-own path.


Include Brave Voice statement builder and audio recording.


Simple interface with placeholder illustrations.


Phase 2: Full Build (6–10 weeks)
Expand storylines and responses.


Add drawing tool and dashboard.


Polish UI/UX for young users.



🧠 Additional Ideas
Add a "Bully Meter" where kids see how different responses affect relationships.


Include mini-games where kids practice choosing assertive vs. passive/aggressive responses.


Allow therapists to personalize content with custom scenarios.



✅ Next Steps
If you're serious about development, I can help:
Write a full app spec document.


Draft screen mockups or UX wireframes.


Prepare scripts and interactive content.


Assist with finding a developer or no-code solution (like Glide, Kodular, or Thunkable).


Would you like me to begin drafting an app spec or wireframe next?
